## My process
I started by structuring the project in HTML and defining the card classes.
Starting from mobile-first, I created the first card and then the mixins with what would be standard on the other cards.
Then I created the partials and implemented the mixins and individual characteristics.
It was very difficult, but I managed to position the quote decoration on the first card.
I then moved to the Desktop, applying the breakdown for screens larger than 940px and then the display grid on the body. 
Then I positioned the cards as the challenge requires. I finished the cards by applying the box-shadow
